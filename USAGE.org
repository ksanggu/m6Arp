* Inference

To predict the presence of a modification, one needs to know the following things:

1. A trained model
2. A file containing per-read, per-position stats. These are generated with Tombo + prsconv3
3. The site at which to make a prediction.

One can then make predictions using our =inference.py= script like so.

#+begin_src shell
python inference.py --model ./pretrained/model8975.pkl \
       --csv ./data/8975pos_newF1F2GL_fishers0.csv \
       --site 8975 \
       --output pred.csv
#+end_src

This will output a csv =pred.csv= with per-read predictions for the presence of
a modification at the specified site.
